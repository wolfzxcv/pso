## PSO

### Info

- As we don't draw all the results in this project, I decided to code it without classes, store only the values that we need for further decisions or calculation.
- Final result is shown on the page, details are in the browser console.
- Currently, my modified version is not always better than SPSO.

### Usage

- Modify line 22 and 23 for search range (see below)
- Modify line 306 to change the benchmark functions

### Benchmark functions list
